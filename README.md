## 🤖 Advanced Features

### Association Rule Mining

SmartLab uses a sophisticated association rule mining algorithm to discover patterns in equipment borrowing behavior.

#### How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Analyzes historical borrowing data
2. **Pattern Discovery**: Identifies frequently co-borrowed items
3. **Metric Calculation**:
   - **Support**: Frequency of item pairs
   - **Confidence**: Probability of borrowing item B given item A
   - **Lift**: Strength of association (>1 indicates positive correlation)

#### Practical Example

```
Pattern Found: Beaker → Test Tube
├─ Support: 45.2% (borrowed together in 45% of cases)
├─ Confidence: 78.5% (78.5% of Beaker borrowers also get Test Tubes)
└─ Lift: 2.3 (strong positive correlation)

Result: When a student adds Beaker to cart,
        Test Tube is recommended with high confidence
```

#### Implementation

```dart
// Get recommendations based on cart items
final recommendations = await AssociationMiningService.getRecommendations(
  currentCartItems,
  maxRecommendations: 5,
);
```

#### Tunable Parameters

```dart
minSupport: 0.02      // Minimum 2% occurrence rate
minConfidence: 0.3    // Minimum 30% confidence
minLift: 1.0          // Only positive correlations
```

### Smart Cart System

The cart intelligently suggests related items as you add equipment:

```
Your Cart:
├─ Beaker (x2)
├─ Bunsen Burner (x1)
│
└─ 💡 You might also need:
   ├─ ✨ Test Tube
   ├─ ✨ Pipette
   └─ ✨ Thermometer

   Based on borrowing patterns
```

### Real-time Notifications

- Request approval/rejection alerts
- Equipment availability updates
- Due date reminders
- System announcements

### Database URL Configuration

Update the Firebase Realtime Database URL in multiple files:

```dart
// In lib/home/home_page.dart, lib/home/equipment_page.dart, etc.
FirebaseDatabase.instance.databaseURL =
    'https://YOUR-PROJECT-ID-default-rtdb.YOUR-REGION.firebasedatabase.app';
```

### Security Rules

Update `database.rules.json`:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": "auth != null",
    "users": {
      "$uid": {
        ".write": "$uid === auth.uid"
      }
    },
    "borrow_requests": {
      ".indexOn": ["userId", "status", "requestedAt"]
    },
    "equipment_categories": {
      ".indexOn": ["title"]
    }
  }
}
```
